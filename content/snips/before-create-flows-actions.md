Your snip content goes here. Keep it short and to the pointâ€”think of a fleeting
note.

When using invocable actions to drive updates in a before trigger context, we
are unable to use a flow. The fast updates flows do not seem to support actions.  
The alternative seems to be a trigger in the before create before update
context.  
Need to consider whether such heavy processing should happen in a before trigger
context in any case. This would slow down creation, even while it is technically
feasible.
